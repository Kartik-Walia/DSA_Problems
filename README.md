# DSA_Problems

## Overview

This repository contains daily solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from various platforms, including LeetCode, CodeStudio, GeeksforGeeks, and InterviewBit. The solutions are organized into separate folders for each platform, making it easy to navigate and find specific problems.

## Repository Structure

- **CodeStudio**: Solutions to DSA problems from CodeStudio, organized by question name.
- **GeeksforGeeks**: Solutions to DSA problems from GeeksforGeeks, organized by question name.
- **InterviewBit**: Solutions to DSA problems from InterviewBit, organized by question name.
- **LeetCode**: Solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by question name and number.

## Navigation

### LeetCode

In the LeetCode folder, you can search for solutions using either the question name or the question number. LeetCode question numbers are included in the file names for easy reference.

### Other Platforms

For CodeStudio, GeeksforGeeks, and InterviewBit, you can navigate directly to the respective folders to find solutions organized by question name.

## Daily Updates

A new DSA problem solution is added daily, ensuring a consistent stream of practice and learning. Feel free to explore the solutions, contribute improvements, or suggest additional problems.
